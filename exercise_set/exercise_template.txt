Write a method PROBLEM NAME
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION HERE

You can assume the input will always be GIVEN INPUT
(i.e. no need to check for input type or type of elements)

Try to write a recursive solution! A recursive solution includes:
  1. Checking for the base case and returning a value
  2. If the base case is not met, taking a step that moves
     towards the base case
  3. Calling the method/function

Recursive solutions also - ideally - do not mutate the given inputs.

The three steps above don't necessarily come in that order or each
occupy their own line - some might share lines, you could write the
order differently, etc.

How to figure out the base case?
  A base case can be thought as the simplest version of the given 
  input. In this case, INPUT IS THIS COMPLICATED. What might
  the simplest version of this input be?

Feel free to write your own test cases in addition to the ones below.
