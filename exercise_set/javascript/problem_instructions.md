# JavaScript Problem Instructions
Write a function that solves the given problem recursively.
This means the function must call itself at some point.
You can assume the input will always be of the given type
indicated and that any nested elements will also always be 
of the given type indicated, i.e. no need to check for input type
or type of elements

Try to write a recursive solution! A recursive solution includes:
   1. Checking for the base case and returning a value
   2. If the base case is not met, taking a step that moves
      towards the base case
   3. Calling the method

Recursive solutions also - ideally - do not mutate the given inputs.

The three steps above don't necessarily come in that order or each
occupy their own line - some might share lines, you could write the
order differently, etc.

## How to figure out the base case?
A base case can be thought as the simplest version of the given 
input. Your input will often be lists of elements, strings of
characters, big numbers that could be made smaller. To figure out
the base case, ask yourself "What might the simplest version of this input be?

Feel free to write your own test cases in addition to the ones provided.

If you're stumped, there is a hint file provided for each problem.
At least one solution is provided for each problem and some problems
may also have additional solutions provided. These are not the only
way to write recursive solutions, they are just meant to demonstrate
a potential solution and hopefully give you some ideas.

All problem files include the helper functions head and tail - use these functions!

Good luck!
